## ECS

Welcome to [Elton's Container Show](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXl_isu8qxvm4CzwO5I27QxrdmxCzpS2E)!

This is where I talk about Docker and Kubernetes, the container ecosystem, practices and architecture - and all things containery.

Every month I'll cover a different theme in sessions which are full of demos and walk-throughs. All the demos are documented here so you can follow along for yourself and expand your container knowledge and experience.

## About Me

I'm a freelance consultant and trainer - specializing in Docker, Kubernetes and Microsoft Azure.

I'm the author of:

* [Learn Docker in a Month of Lunches](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-docker-in-a-month-of-lunches?utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=affiliate&a_aid=elton&a_bid=5890141b) and

* [Learn Kubernetes in a Month of Lunches](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-kubernetes-in-a-month-of-lunches?utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=affiliate&a_aid=elton&a_bid=a506ee0d)

> And over 20 [training courses on Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.pxf.io/YMBGB), covering topics on Docker and Kubernetes, Azure and .NET, SRE and CI/CD.

I spent most of my career as a consultant, designing and building large enterprise applications. Then I discovered the container revolution in 2014, joined Docker and worked with the team for three fast and furious years. 

Now I help people break up those old enterprise apps and build new cloud-native apps - and run them all in Docker and Kubernetes. I speak and run workshops at conferences around the world (pandemics permitting), write books and video courses and I help organizations at every stage in their container journey. 

I'm an 11-time [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/4028368) and a [Docker Captain](https://www.docker.com/captains/elton-stoneman).
