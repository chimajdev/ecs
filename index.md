## ECS

Welcome to [Elton's Container Show](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXl_isu8qxvm4CzwO5I27QxrdmxCzpS2E)!

This is where I talk about Docker and Kubernetes, the container ecosystem, practices and architecture - and all things containery.

Every month I'll cover a different theme in sessions which are full of demos and walk-throughs. All the demos are documented here so you can follow along for yourself and expand your container knowledge and experience.

## About Me

I'm a freelance consultant and trainer - specializing in Docker, Kubernetes and Microsoft Azure. 

I spent most of my career as a consultant, designing and building large enterprise applications. Then I discovered the container revolution in 2014, joined Docker and worked with the team for three fast and furious years. 

Now I help people break up those old enterprise apps and build new cloud-native apps - and run them all in Docker and Kubernetes. I speak and run workshops at conferences around the world (pandemics permitting), write books and video courses and I help organizations at every stage in their container journey. 

I'm an 11-time [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/4028368) and a [Docker Captain](https://www.docker.com/captains/elton-stoneman).

I'm the author of:
