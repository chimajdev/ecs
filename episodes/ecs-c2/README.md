## ECS-C1: Continuous Integration with Docker and Jenkins

Continuous Integration is about building your apps on every change and on a regular schedule. It used to mean maintaining and managing build servers and complex build scripts - where the build for production was nothing like the developer workflow. Not any more...

In this episode we'll combine multi-stage Dockerfiles with a build infrastructure running in containers, to make for a simple and portable approach to CI. We'll use Jenkins and run all the components locally using Docker.
