## ECS-C3: GitOps with Kubernetes and Argo

GitOps inverts the Continuous Deployment model. Your production environment watches a Git repo for changes. When there's a new deployment, the production cluster pulls those changes in. 

It's an approach which is becoming very popular. It reduces the number of systems involved in deployment, helps to keep your production environment secure and ensures your entire setup is reproducible.

In this episode we'll see how GitOps works, using Argo - a CNCF project - to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster running in Azure.
