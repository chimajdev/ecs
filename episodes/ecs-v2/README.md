## ECS-V2: Logging with Elasticsearch, Fluentd and Kibana

Configuring your applications to write logs as container logs is the easy part. When you're running with dozens or hundreds of containers in production you need a centralized system to store and search your logs. One of the most popular approaches is with the EFK stack: Elasticsearch, Fluentd and Kibana.

In this episode you'll learn how to run Fluentd (and Fluent Bit) to collect all your container logs and forward them to Elasticsearch for storage. Then you have a central log store with indexed log entries, and you'll see how to use Kibana to search and visualize log data.
