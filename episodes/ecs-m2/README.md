## ECS-M2: Service Mesh with Linkerd on Kubernetes

Linkerd is the original service mesh for Kubernetes. It has all the features we looked at last week and it's easy to get started with. This week we'll see how to deploy Linkerd and use it to manage the communication in a sample app. We'll have Linkerd automatically register components into the mesh and use it to control traffic flow, add security and power observability.

Linkerd is a CNCF project with an active community, and a commercially-supported offering. It's solid and fast, and it's used by some pretty big companies - like eBay, Strava and Walmart.
